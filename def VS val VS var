In Scala We have 3 things are very important

i) def

ii) var

iii)val


1) Def : Defines a method

here are three ways of defining things in Scala:

def defines a method
val defines a fixed value (which cannot be modified)
var defines a variable (which can be modified)
Looking at your code:

def person = new Person("Kumar",12)
This defines a new method called person. You can call this method only without () because it is defined as parameterless method. For empty-paren method, you can call it with or without '()'. If you simply write:

person
then you are calling this method (and if you don't assign the return value, it will just be discarded). In this line of code:

person.age = 20
what happens is that you first call the person method, and on the return value (an instance of class Person) you are changing the age member variable.

And the last line:

println(person.age)
Here you are again calling the person method, which returns a new instance of class Person (with age set to 12). It's the same as this:

println(person().age)
